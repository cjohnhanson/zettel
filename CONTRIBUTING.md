# Contributing

## Use of AI

Say so in the pull request when a coding assistant wrote part of the
change. Disclosure is expected, not disqualifying.

You must be able to explain the change in your own words. Write your own
comments on the pull request. A pull request the author cannot explain
gets closed.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cjohnhanson/zettel
cd zettel
cargo build
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

Pass `--all-features`. The `mcp` feature is off by default, and a test
run without it never compiles that code.

## Open an issue first

Open a GitHub issue before a large change. A small fix needs no issue.

The maintainer tracks work in markdown files under `.tisket/`. Those are
read-only to a contributor. Read them with `cat`, or with
[tisket](https://github.com/cjohnhanson/tisket):

```sh
tisket issue list
tisket issue show <id>
```

## The gates

Two gates decide whether a change lands. CI runs both as the check
named `gate`. `main` is protected and requires that check.

A pull request needs a review note on its head commit, the same as a
push. CI checks out a merge commit GitHub creates, which no reviewer
saw, so the gate reads the note from the branch head instead.

The commit gate runs two checks, and refuses a commit when unstaged
Rust changes differ from the index:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

The merge gate runs the tests, then requires a review note:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

A push carries a review note on its tip, holding one sign-off line per
review. `.gaff/gaff.yml` declares which reviews a change must pass.
Read the list with:

```sh
gaff reviews
```

Today that is `fresh-eyes` and `mutation`. A reviewer who did not write
the change reads it, then removes a guard the change adds and watches a
named test go red. Each sign-off is one line, anchored at the start of
a line, naming the commit it reviewed:

```sh
git notes --ref=reviews add -m \
'signoff[fresh-eyes] PASS 4f1c2ab read the parser and every guard
signoff[mutation] PASS 4f1c2ab removed the FAIL branch, a_failed_signoff went red' <sha>
```

Prose around the lines is ignored, so a note can carry a narrative too.

Six things refuse a push: no sign-off for a declared review, a verdict
of `FAIL`, a sign-off naming a different commit, two sign-offs for one
review, evidence under three words, and no note at all.

The commit binding is the load-bearing part. Without it a sign-off
copies forward onto a later commit nobody read, and nothing says so.

Prose alone is not a sign-off, and that rule has a reason. A note
reading `mutation: skipped this round` names the review, so the first
version of this check passed it. So did `fresh-eyes: FAILED, do not
merge`.

## Running the gates locally

The gates are declared once, in `.gaff/gaff.yml`. CI reads that file, so
CI and a local run cannot drift.

**Do not install the hooks for a one-off contribution.** They refuse a
push without a review note, so an outside contributor cannot push at
all. Open a pull request and let CI run the gates.

For sustained work, install them with
[gaff](https://github.com/cjohnhanson/gaff). The hooks call it, so it
must be on your `PATH`:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/cjohnhanson/gaff
gaff init --git
```

To run the gates without committing:

```sh
gaff ci
```

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main`, and open the pull request from a fork.
2. Keep the change and its tests together.
3. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` for a user-visible change.
4. Write the commit message in the imperative present. State what the
   change does. State why where the diff does not show it.

## What not to commit

Nothing here is checked automatically. `.gitignore` stops build output
and local editor state. The other two are on you:

- Anything under `target/`.
- An absolute path naming a home directory. It exposes an account name,
  and it breaks every other clone.
- A `path = "..."` dependency override pointing outside the repository.
  Put it in `.cargo/config.toml`, which is ignored.
- Local editor or coding-agent state.
