# hook is the merge check. A push needs green tests, a green missouri
# suite, and a recorded fresh-eyes review.

# The review record is a git note on the pushed tip:
#   git notes --ref=reviews add -m "fresh-eyes: <who> <scope>" <sha>

# and its test coverage. A note without a review makes the gate false.

# the pushed commit. A fresh clone has no hooks until `gaff init --git`
# runs; `gaff check` reports that state.
