# The merge gate. These repos merge by direct push, so this pre-push
# hook is the merge check. A push needs green tests, a green missouri
# suite, and a sign-off for every review .gaff/gaff.yml declares.
#
# The review record is a git note on the pushed tip:
#   git notes --ref=reviews add -m 'signoff[<review>] PASS <sha> <evidence>' <sha>
# Write a note only after an independent reviewer has read the change
# and its test coverage. A note without a review makes the gate false.
#
# The gate has three known limits. The suites test the working tree,
# not the pushed commit. A fresh clone has no hooks until `gaff init
# --git` runs; `gaff check` reports that state. And a merge queue or a
# direct push by GitHub runs no pre-push hook, so CI on the push event
# is what gates those.
