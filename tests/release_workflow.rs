//! The release workflow, read as text.
//!
//! No job in the workflow runs before a tag, and a tag publishes to
//! registries that never take a version back. A reviewer found the
//! workflow packing a package path the generator never writes,
//! publishing from a glob that matched nothing, and downloading an
//! archive under a name the build never uploads. Every suite was green.
//! These tests read the workflow against the files it names, so the
//! next rename fails here and not on a tag.
